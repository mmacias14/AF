This project was developed for an Air Force customer to optimize student pilot flow through a training program.  The app uses an integer program solver (lpSolve) to find class size solutions that minimize pipeline backlog.  The app.R produces an RShiny app that allows the user to adjust resource inputs and analyze the tradespace for different types of solutions.
